# color-track
This Python program uses OpenCV library to track the position of a specific colored object in real-time video by creating a color mask, detecting the object contours, and calculating the centroid of the object. It subscribes to ROS topics '/odom', '/scan', and '/camera/rgb/image_raw' to get the current robot pose, laser scan data, and camera image respectively. It publishes the safe motion of the robot to the ROS topic '/safe_cmd_vel'. The program centers the robot camera on the target object if it is in view by rotating the robot so that the colored region remains centered. The color information is a min and max RGB value in targetCol=[minrgb,maxrgb]. The program extracts moments of the target image and calculates the distance of the X center of the target from the X center of the image. It uses this to generate a proportional angular velocity and move the robot towards the target. The program also records proof of reaching the goal and saves an image of it.
